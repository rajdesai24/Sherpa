# Problem Category
Removing the Language Barrier
# Problem Statement
With the massive increase in the communication and technology sector, the world has surely becaome a very small place. But here comes an issue of language barrier, 
for poeple travelling across different countries. If we take an example of India, language spoken by the native poeple literally chnanges in every state. Thus, it becomes very
important and challenging for them to carry out their travelling journeys overcoming linguistic barriers. Especially those who travel alone need to work and rresearch a lot in
order to do even the most basic tasks, such as ordering food from menu, which is obviously written in a different language, asking for directions, or tour suggestions.

Our web application has tried to cover this aspect of travelling complications. We have built an app which lets people know about what is happening around them. As soon as they 
move to a different place, they will see a list of clubs made by the localites dwelling in that area or city. They can join any or as many clubs they wish to, in order to know 
what interests them the most. After joining a club, they would be redirected to a page where mmultiple chatrooms are made, on the basis of the club agenda. This feature tries to
remove the chaos if too many people are part of the same club. After joining a particular chatroom, the user would be able to read all the chats done by the group members. Here the 
user will type in his/her native language, while the others will type in their local language, and a real time translation will take place such that the user will recieve all the
messages in his chosen language, while the other local people in the group would get the user's messages in their anative language.

The chatRoom would be the platform where everyone would discuss the plans of meeting.
